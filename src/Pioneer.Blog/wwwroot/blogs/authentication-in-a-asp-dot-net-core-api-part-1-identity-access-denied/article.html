<div class="note">
  <p>In this series, I am going to outline some basic approaches to authenticating your .NET Core API using either ASP.NET Core
    Identity or token-based authentication with a JSON Web Token (JWT). I will also explore how to configure your application
    to return proper response types to both Redirect To Login and Redirect To Access Denied events when using ASP.NET Core
    Identity.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>To demonstrate these concepts of authentication, I will use the
  <a href="https://github.com/PioneerCode/pioneer-blog">Pioneer Code Blog</a> source code to illustrate how I secured API endpoints that allow for CRUD operations against the
  supporting tables in its database. That being said, let's take look at the file structure and identify where the API controllers
  exist today.</p>
<a href="/blogs/authentication-in-a-asp-dot-net-core-api-part-1-identity-access-denied/solution-explorer-start.jpg" target="blank"
  title="Solution Explorer Area API Endpoints">
  <img src="/blogs/authentication-in-a-asp-dot-net-core-api-part-1-identity-access-denied/solution-explorer-start.jpg" alt="Solution Explorer Area API Endpoints"
    style="max-width: 336px;" />
</a>
<p>As you can see, I created an Area to house all my operations that are related to the administration of my site. Notably,
  those that allow me to managed my blog posts. In the Area titled "Admin" lives a collection of API Controllers that correspond
  to individual tables (entities) in the database.</p>
<p class="note">For more information about creating Areas, you can visit my blog post entitled
  <a href="http://pioneercode.com/post/creating-areas-in-asp-net-core"
    target="_blank" title="Creating Areas In ASP.NET MVC Core">Creating Areas In ASP.NET MVC Core</a>. </p>
<p>To keep things simple lets focus on a single endpoint that lives in a single API controller.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">[Route("api/categories")]
public class CategoryApiController : Controller
{
  private readonly ICategoryService _categoryService;

  public CategoryApiController(ICategoryService categoryService)
  {
    _categoryService = categoryService;
  }

  [HttpGet]
  public IEnumerable&lt;Category&gt; GetAll(int? count, int? page)
  {
    if (count == null || page == null)
    {
      return _categoryService.GetAll();
    }

    return _categoryService.GetAllPaged((int)count, (int)page);
  }
}</pre>
<p>Here you can see an endpoint the maps to a GET request on the
  <b>api/categories</b> endpoint. If we make a request to this endpoint, we will get a collection of categories with a Response
  of
  <b>200 OK</b>.</p>

<h2>ASP.NET Identity</h2>
<blockquote>
  ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system which allows you to add login functionality to your application. Users can create
  an account and login with a username and password or they can use an external login providers such as Facebook, Google,
  Microsoft Account, Twitter and more.
  <cite>
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity" title="ASP.Net Core Identity" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core Identity</a>
  </cite>
</blockquote>
<p>We will start out securing our API endpoints by introducing ASP.NET Core Identity into our application. If you are working
  on an MVC project, Identity is available in the
  <b>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder</b> lib. Of which, is scaffold in just about every MVC project you are creating. On the other
  hand, if you are creating an API without the "typical" MVC lib project dependencies, you might have to add a reference
  to
  <b>&lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.BrowserLink.Loader" Version="14.1.0" /&gt;</b> in your csproj
  file.</p>
<h3>Setting up DbContext</h3>
<p>Before we configure our Identity service, we first must ensure our database is in order. To do this, I needed to implement
  my existing
  <b>Blog Context</b> as a derived class of
  <b>IdentityDbContext&lt;UserEntity&gt;</b>. I set the type as
  <b>UserEntity</b>, which itself is a derived class of
  <b>IdentityUser</b>. Once the context was setup, I ran my Entity Framework migrations to scaffold the necessary tables.</p>
<p>In short, this now ensures my db context has all the necessary configuration needed for Identity and my
  <b>UserEntity</b> shares all the base types provided by
  <b>IdentityUser</b> while being expendable to suite any future needs.</p>
<h3>Configuring Identity</h3>
<p>Once our data store is in order, we can now add and configure our Identity Service. In the
  <b>Startup.ConfigServices(IServiceCollection services)</b> function, I added the following.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">services.AddIdentity&lt;UserEntity, IdentityRole&gt;()
  .AddEntityFrameworkStores&lt;BlogContext&gt;();</pre>
<p>This effectively adds Identity to the Pioneer Blog services collection.</p>
<p>Next, we need to tell our application to use Identity. This need to be done before we add MVC in order to apply authentication
  to our MVC calls do to order of operation concerns.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app,
  IHostingEnvironment env,
  ILoggerFactory loggerFactory,
  IdentitySetup identitySetup)
  {
  // Shortened.....
  app.UseIdentity();
  // Add MVC
}</pre>
<h2>Authorization Attribute</h2>
<p>In order to tell Identity that we don't want to allow unauthorized user access to our endpoint, we need to add the Authorization
  Attribute to either a class or directly on a method. This depends on the scope you want to apply to your authorization
  plan. In my case, I will apply this attribute to a backing service method that supports my GET Categories API Controller
  endpoint.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">[Authorize]
[HttpGet]
public IEnumerable&lt;Category&gt; GetAll(int? count, int? page)
{
  if (count == null || page == null)
  {
    return _categoryService.GetAll();
  }

  return _categoryService.GetAllPaged((int)count, (int)page);
}</pre>
<p>Let's try hitting our API endpoint again.</p>
<a href="/blogs/authentication-in-a-asp-dot-net-core-api-part-1-identity-access-denied/failed-redirect.jpg" target="blank"
  title="Fail and Redirect">
  <img src="/blogs/authentication-in-a-asp-dot-net-core-api-part-1-identity-access-denied/failed-redirect.jpg" alt="Fail and Redirect"
    style="max-width: 899px;" />
</a>
<p>This time around we are not getting any Categories back in the Response. Which is great, this is what we wanted. But what
  about our Status Code being
  <b>200 OK</b> and the Response payload returning HTML? This happened because Identity by default is configured to redirect
  an unauthenticated request to a login in page.</p>
<p>This obviously does not suit our APIs needs. That being said, let's configure our
  <b>IdentityOptions</b> to take in account cases where we do not want to redirect to login and instead we want to return a
  <b>401 Unauthorized</b> response. In the
  <b>Startup.ConfigServices(IServiceCollection services)</b> method add the following.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">services.Configure&lt;IdentityOptions&gt;(config =&gt;
{
  config.Cookies.ApplicationCookie.Events =
  new CookieAuthenticationEvents
  {
      OnRedirectToLogin = ctx =>
      {
          if (ctx.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/api") && ctx.Response.StatusCode == 200)
          {
              ctx.Response.StatusCode = 401;
              return Task.FromResult&lt;object&gt;(null);
          }

          ctx.Response.Redirect(ctx.RedirectUri);
          return Task.FromResult&lt;object&gt;(null);
      }
  };
});</pre>
<p>In the
  <b>IdentityOptions</b> configuration we are setting up a way to intercept an Event, of which is the
  <b>OnRedirectToLogin</b> Event. When this Event is raised, we first check our URL segment to see if it starts with "/api".
  If it does and the response is of type
  <b>200 OK</b>, we know we have run into the exact issue identified above. This time, we will return immediately with a status
  code of
  <b>401 Unauthorized</b>.</p>

  title="401 Identity">
  <img src="/blogs/authentication-in-a-asp-dot-net-core-api-part-1-identity-access-denied/401-identity.jpg" alt="401 Identity"
    style="max-width: 899px;" />
</a>
<p>That is it! We now have a way to block access to API endpoints of our choosing using Identity. In the next part of this series,
  I will talk about adding a way to register a user using Identity and allowing access to API endpoints that require authentication.</p>
