<p>Recently the folks at Microsoft have blessed us with a brand new
  <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating" title="DotNet Template GitHub Repository"
    target="_blank">Template Engine</a>, of which is invoked by the
  <b>dotnet new</b> command in the .NET Core command-line interface (CLI). With it comes the ability to create and scaffold
  templates that will suit just about any need you have. Be it the desire to template a new project or a simple sub-section
  of a larger project, the Template Engine has you covered.</p>
<p>Those who are going to want to contribute to the
  <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating" title="DotNet Template GitHub Repository"
    target="_blank">Template Engine</a> project or are simply interested in having the latest development features available to them, are going
  to need to understand how to work directly with the Template Engine code. That being said, I recently have gone through
  the pain of early adoption and have managed to figure out how to build and debug the code with some help and guidance coming
  directly from the Microsoft team responsible for this project. Following I will outline the steps needed to so such using
  Visual Studio.</p>
<h2>Getting The Code</h2>
<p>As noted above, the
  <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating" title="DotNet Template GitHub Repository" target="_blank">Template Engine's</a> official repository lives on GitHub. Depending on your intentions, you are going to want to do one
  of two things.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you plan on contributing to the codebase, you will want to fork the repository to your own account and clone directly
    from there.</li>
  <li>If you are simply looking to produce a build of the latest code, you can clone directly from the Template Engine repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is worth noting that the current "default" branch is the working development branch. The "master" branch is the build
  branch and it does not accept contributions directly.</p>
<h2>Building & Running</h2>
<p>Now that you have the code locally, open up a command prompt and navigation to the root of the repository. Here you will
  find two "setup" scripts.
  <b>Setup.cmd</b> which is for Windows and
  <b>Setup.sh</b> which is for Mac or Linux. Based on your environment, run the appropriate script. This will kick of a series
  of automated build steps that will create a new command,
  <b>dotnet new3</b>, and make it available n your command line.</p>

    alt="Setup scripts" />
</a>
<p>The entire build takes about a minute to complete and you should end up with something similar to the following.</p>
<a href="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/build-success.png" title="Successful Template Engine Build"

    alt="Successful Template Engine Build" />
</a>
<p>Now that we have a successful build, we can start passing arguments against the newly added
  <b>dotnet new3</b> command. Anything that is available in
  <b>dotnet new</b> should be available in
  <b>dotnet new3</b> plus any additional features that are available in the development branch you used for the build. For more
  info on what currently is in development, I would recommend keeping and eye on the repository
  <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating/issues"
    title="DotNet Template GitHub Issues">Issues</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating/projects" title="DotNet Template GitHub Repository">Projects</a> pages.</p>
<p class="note">It is worth mentioning that currently the life-cycle of your current build is limited to your current command-line session.
  Meaning, when you close the command line that session will be terminated. Of which will require to re-build the next time
  you open up a new session. </p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>In order to debug the Template Engine code, your current
  <b>dotnet new3</b> session needs to be configured to "DEBUG" and a debugger needs to be attached to the running
  <b>dotnet-new3.exe</b> process.</p>
<h4>Configuring dontnet new3 To DEBUG</h4>
<p>Open up a new command line session and navigate to the root of your project. In the root, you will find a script called
  <b>dn3buildmode-debug.cmd</b>. Execute this script.</p>
<a href="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/debug.png" title="debug script"
  target="_blank">
  <img src="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/debug.png" style="max-width: 506px;"
    alt="debug script" />
</a>
<p>Upon completion you should end up with the following.</p>
<a href="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/debug-mode.png" title="debug script complete"
  target="_blank">
  <img src="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/debug-mode.png" style="max-width: 465px;"
    alt="debug script complete" />
</a>
<p>Now that
  <b>dotnet new3</b> is set to DEBUG, we need to re-run the
  <b>setup</b> script applicable to our environment so that we will have a fresh
  <b>donet new3</b> session available at our command line.</p>
<h4>Trigger A Breakpoint</h4>
<p>Open up the
  <b>Microsoft.Templating.sln</b> solution inside Visual Studio. This solution contains the projects needed to run, modify and
  debug the Template Engine. In the
  <b>Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Cli</b> project, locate the class named
  <b>New3Command</b> and navigate to function named
  <b>Run</b>.</p>
<p>In the
  <b>Run</b> function, there is a block of logic that checks the list of arguments passed along side your
  <b>dotnet new3</b> command for an argument of
  <b>--debug:attach</b>. If this argument is supplied, a
  <b>Console.Readline()</b> request will be triggered. This effectively pauses the Template Engine at an early point in its
  execution. At any point past the
  <b>Console.Readline()</b>, set a breakpoint.</p>
<a href="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/breakpoint.png" title="Breakpoint"
  target="_blank">
  <img src="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/breakpoint.png" style="max-width: 1317px;"
    alt="Breakpoint" />
</a>
<p>Head back to your command line session and run the following.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">dotnet new3 --debug:attach {{additonal args}}</pre>
<p>In your console window you will see an empty new line, of which is the
  <b>Console.Readline()</b> request being triggered. This will now give you an opportunity to attach your debugger.</p>

  target="_blank">
  <img src="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/newline.png" style="max-width: 465px;"
    alt="Console Realine Trigger" />
</a>
<p>In Visual Studio, open the
  <b>Attach To Process</b> window from the Debug menu or by hitting the following keyboard shortcut -
  <b>ctrl+alt+p</b>. Locate the
  <b>dotnet-new3.exe</b> process, highlight it and hit the attach button.</p>
<a href="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/attach.png" title="Attach process"
  target="_blank">
  <img src="/blogs/building-and-debugging-the-dot-net-new-templating-engine-in-visual-studio/attach.png" style="max-width: 856px;"
    alt="Console Realine Trigger" />
</a>
<p>Head back to your command line and hit enter. This will trigger the
  <b>Console.Readline()</b> to return and allow the breakpoint that you set to bit hit.</p>

</a>
<p class="note">The steps I outlined are specific to debugging in Visual Studio. That being said, debugging generally can take place in any
  application that allows you to "attach to process".</p>
