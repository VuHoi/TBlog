<blockquote>Let me preface this post with the following. The work that has been done on
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows"
    title=".NET Core" target="_blank"> .NET Core 1.0</a> and the tooling supporting it inside of Visual Studio is fantastic. It is a wonderful representation
  of how much Microsoft has listened to the community's needs and desires and signifies a clear path towards the future.
  I for one, am all in.</blockquote>
<p>Those of use who use Visual Studio as their main IDE will, for the most part, proclaim it to be unmatched in quality of features.
  A great debugging experience and world-class Intellisense are bolstered by a slew of tooling features, making for an efficient
  and productive environment to work in.</p>
<p>For all the good, given the opportunity, a lot of
  <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx"
    target="_blank" title="Visual Studio">Visual Studio</a> users will still be able to present an exhaustive list of things that they "wish" were different. </p>
<p>Personally, one of my main complaints revolves around the idea Visual Studio assumes to know what you as a developer wants.
  </p>
<p>For example, in most project types, file tracking in a Solution is opt-in. When adding a file outside of Visual Studio using
  Windows File Explorer to your Solution directory, you need to explicitly tell it "Hey, I want to see this file inside my
  IDE." </p>
<p>Now as a .NET developer and long time user of Visual Studio, I certainly have come to terms with this over the years. What
  was once an issue has magically turned into an inconvenience that up until the last few years, I flat out stopped questioning.</p>
<h2>What exactly is the issue?</h2>
<p class="note">The problem with settling into acceptance is that we forget to challenge the existence we live in.</p>
<p>About two years ago I was reminded of this on one of my weekly huddles. This team consisted of what most would consider being
  the hip modern web developer types. You know, the I only use NodeJs, React and any other new flavors of the month type.</p>
<p>I was bringing them up to speed on an ASP.NET 4.x project that they were going contribute to and there number one concern
  was if they had to use Visual Studio. I kid you not, the words "your files do not even show up in Visual Studio when you
  add them to a folder" where said out loud. </p>
<p>
  <em>- Based on pure logic, how was I or anyone else to argue this?</em>
</p>
<h2>Desires to attract new developers.</h2>
<p>Since the concept of .NET Core was born, time and time again I heard from those at Microsoft that .NET Core was more than
  a technology shift. In addition to improvements in technology, it was also to serve as an avenue to shift the way developers
  outside of the .NET world perceived Microsoft. </p>
<p>I once heard Scott Hanselman talk about his desire to attract developers that are starting out their development career's
  or are still in school. To make them feel like the investment in .NET will help align them with a broad community of developers
  who are all marching to the same beat. To not further perpetuate the stigma that surrounds .NET developers and make it
  a logic choice to all developer instead of the select.</p>
<p>Let's face the facts, the stigma Microsoft faces is real and will take a lot of effort to overcome. You can only hold a developers
  attention for so long when trying to convince them to believe in a new development stack. The slightest chink in the armor
  of the developers testing out the waters of .NET and Visual Studio for the first time, can send them running for the hills.
  </p>
<p>If Microsoft is to attract new developers, every opportunity they have to make the .NET development story a more familiar
  and comfortable experience, they must approach with the up most critical eye. </p>
<h2>.NET Core and the evolution of tooling.</h2>
<p class="note">Tooling in the open-source community always ends up with a familiar lexicon.</p>
<p>ASP.NET Core and the tooling supplied in Visual Studio is a great step towards removing the idea that Visual Studio knows
  what the developer wants (Opt-Out) and has shifted a lot of the experience to Opt-In. </p>
<p>Once such scenario that I came across the other day where this is not the case, revolves around the experience of using
  <a
    href="https://bower.io/" title="Bower" target="_blank">Bower</a> in a .NET Core project.
    <a href="https://bower.io/" title="Bower" target="_blank">Bower</a> has had deep roots in a multitude of communities for a while now. Because if this, there is an expectation
    of how we interact with it. That expectation can be argued to be that of the default behavior championed by those who
    developed
    <a href="https://bower.io/" title="Bower" target="_blank">Bower</a>. </p>
<p>If the vast majority of developers are used to working directly with the Bower file, why would the default behavior of Visual
  Studio be to hide it in favor of a GUI? Again, Something we need to Opt-Out of.</p>
<p>If the rest of the world is used to the default location of Bower packages being "bower_components", why would the templates
  provided inside of Visual Studio change that to "wwwroot\libs"? Again, Something we need to Opt-Out of.</p>

<h2>And your point was?</h2>
<p>On the surface, many would argue the
  <a href="https://bower.io/" title="Bower" target="_blank">Bower</a> example as something minor. Stating that those working on Visual Studio are trying to improve the developer experience.
  And to a degree, I can't argue with that. </p>
<p> That being said if the end goal is to provide an experience that is familiar to most, attractive to newcomers and is as least
  alienating as possible to those who have settled into "acceptance", small things like this will continue to result in missed
  opportunities. </p>
