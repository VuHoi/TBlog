<p>I recently migrated the entirety of
  <a href="http://pioneercode.com" title="Pioneer Code" target="_blank">Pioneer Code</a> to
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows" title=".NET Core" target="_blank">.NET Core</a> and with it came new choices on how and where I was going to publish moving forward. Being I am cost conscious
  dev (aren't we all), switching to
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows" title=".NET Core" target="_blankd">.NET Core</a> allowed me to make a jump from IIS specific shared hosting to a fully controlled Linux VM. All while seeing
  a significant percentage of savings.</p>
<h2>Linux Hosting</h2>
<p>Linux VMs are cheap. Much cheaper than your typical IIS hosting. There are also plenty of more companies to choose from.
  <a href="https://www.linode.com/" title="Linode" target="_blank">Linode</a>,
  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/" title="Azure" target="_blank">Azure</a> and
  <a href="https://www.vultr.com/" title="Vultr" target="_blank">Vultr</a> all offer cheap options that can be easily scaled be needed. That being said, I picked
  <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279"
    title="Digital Ocean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> for no other reason than it offers Linux VMs for $5 a month. Can't get much cheaper than that!</p>
<p>Regardless who you choose and once you are past the setup phase specific to that company, the standup of your Linux VM should
  be for the most part identical to what I am going to outline below.</p>
<p class="note">

  <p>Setting up a VM in
    <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="Digital Ocean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> is straight forward.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an account.</li>
    <li>
      Create a Droplet with the following configuration.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Image: Ubuntu 16.04.1 x64
          <ul>
            <li>At the date this was publish, .NET Core was supported on Ubuntu 16.04.x. Be sure to check the
              <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/rid-catalog"

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Size: $5 a month!</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>That is it. You should now receive an email with more details about your newly created VM.</p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" title="SSH" target="_blank">SSH</a>
  </h2>
  <p>Working with a Linux VM typically requires SSH access and there are plenty of options on how to accomplish this in Windows.
    Luckily I created a post on how to do exactly this! Check it out at
    <a href="http://pioneercode.com/post/how-to-install-bash-on-windows-10"
      title="How To Install Bash On WIndows 10" target="_blank">How To Install Bash On Windows 10</a>.</p>
  <p>Once your BASH CLI is ready on your Windows dev machine, SSH into your server.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">ssh root@{ip}</pre>
  <h2>Server Setup</h2>
  <p>
    Setting up a fresh Ubuntu server requires some sanity setup before it is production ready.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirming root login.</li>
    <li>Create a new user.</li>
    <li>Securing login by using Public Key Authentication.</li>
    <li>Setting up a firewall.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No need to reinvent the wheel as all these steps are wonderfully documented at the following
    <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279"
      title="Digital Ocean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> tutorial,

      title="Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 16.04" target="_blank">Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 16.04</a>. </p>
  <h2>Installing .NET Core on your VM</h2>
  <p>Again, remember we are working with Ubuntu 16.04 and by way of these instructions are catered to that particular distribution.
    That being said, .Net Core can be installed on a healthy number of Linux distributions. Head over to
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#ubuntu"
      title=".NET Install Instructions" target="_blank">Dot.Net</a> for a detailed list. </p>
  <p>Run the following commands from your new Bash CLI.</p>
  <h3>1: Add the dotnet feed to apt-get</h3>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/dotnet-release/ xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver apt-mo.trafficmanager.net --recv-keys 417A0893
sudo apt-get update</pre>
  <h3>2: Install the .NET Core SDK</h3>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo apt-get install dotnet-dev-1.0.0-preview2-003131</pre>
  <p class="note">
    At the time of this writing, 1.0.0-preview2-003131 was the latest .NET Core version. Be sure to head over to
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#ubuntu"
      title=".NET Install Instructions" target="_blank">Dot.Net</a> to check for the latest version.
  </p>
  <h3>3: Verify installation</h3>
  <pre class="brush: bash">dotnet</pre>
  <p>You should end up with something like this.</p>

      style="max-width: 903px;" />
  </a>
  <h2>Installing Nginx</h2>
  <p>We will need a production ready web server to use as a proxy for the .NET Core
    <a href="https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/fundamentals/servers.html#kestrel"
      target="_blank" title="Kestrel Server">Kestrel Server</a>.
    <a href="https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/fundamentals/servers.html#kestrel" target="_blank" title="Kestrel Server">Kestrel Server</a> works well in development but being it is still early in its life, it does not have a full feature
    set that might be required for production. For that, we will turn to
    <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" title="NGINX">NGINX</a>.</p>
  <h3>1: Install Nginx</h3>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
sudo service nginx start</pre>
  <h3>2: Let Nginx through the firewall.</h3>
  <p>There are three levels of access we can give Nginx</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Nginx Full
      <ul>
        <li>Opens both 80 and 443.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Nginx HTTP
      <ul>
        <li>Opens 80 only.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Nginx HTTPS
      <ul>
        <li>Opens 443 only.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>As with most things in life, you should explicit about access and only open what you need.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'</pre>
  <h3>3: Verify</h3>
  <p>Run the following command to verify your firewall was setup correctly.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo ufw status</pre>
  <a href="/blogs/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host/verify-nginx-firewall.png"
    title="Nginx Firewall Verify" target="_blank">
    <img src="/blogs/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host/verify-nginx-firewall.png"
      alt="Nginx Firewall Verify" style="max-width: 505px;" />
  </a>
  <p>Run the following command to insure Nginx was setup properly.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">systemctl status nginx</pre>
  <a href="/blogs/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host/verify-nginx.png" title="Verify Nginx"
    target="_blank">
    <img src="/blogs/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host/verify-nginx.png" alt="Nginx"
      style="max-width: 739px;" />
  </a>
  <p>At this point should be able to hit Nginx from the public IP assigned to your server.</p>
  <a href="/blogs/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host/public-nginx.png" title="Nginx in a browser"
    target="_blank">

      style="max-width: 585px;" />
  </a>
  <h2>Configure Reverse Proxy</h2>
  <p>We will need to edit a Ngnix configuration file in order to setup our reverse proxy. To do this from a command line we
    can use
    <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/" title="nano" target="_blank">nano</a>. If not already installed, run the following commands.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nano</pre>
  <p>Once installed, open the config file in question by running the following.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default</pre>
  <p>In the following picture you will see what I used to get started. Any place that there is a # in the first column, it signifies
    something I commented out. Any lines that are highlighted, it signifies something I added. Anything that is off screen
    is commented out by default.</p>

  </a>
  <p>Commit and save your changes by hitting
    <b>ctrl+x</b>, then
    <b>y</b> and finally
    <b>enter</b>.</p>
  <p>Run the following command to insure your changes checkout as valid syntax for Nginx configuration.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo nginx -t</pre>
  <p>Run the following command to tell Nginx to reload based on our new configuration.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo nginx -s reload</pre>
  <p class="note">The demonstrated configurations boils down the bear minimum needed to run the reverse proxy service. It is highly recommend
    that you take the time to fully understand
    <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/" title="Ngnix configuration"
      target="_blank">Ngnix configuration</a> and insure you server is secure.</p>
  <h2>Publish Your Site</h2>
  <p>There are few different methods for publishing a site, framework-dependent deployment (FDD) and self-contained deployments
    (SCD).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>FDD</b> - Your app takes a dependency on the server having the appropriate .NET Core release installed on said server.</li>
    <li>
      <b>SCD</b> - Your app is deployed with the entire .NET Core framework as part of its release assets. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more information, I recommend heading over to the official
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/deploying/"
      title="NET Core Application Deployment documentation" target="_blank">NET Core Application Deployment documentation</a>.</p>
  <p>What ever process deployment type your application uses, the following should generally hold true.</p>
  <h3>1: Build Assets On Your Windows Machine.</h3>
  <p>On you development machine (in our a case our Windows machine), open a command prompt at the root of your web application
    and run the following.</p>
  <p>
    <b>FDD</b>
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">dotnet publish -c release</pre>
  <p>
    <b>SCD</b>
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">dotnet publish -c release -r ubuntu.16.04-x64</pre>
  <p>After completing, your assets will end up in one of the following folder depending on your release type.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>FDD</b>: ../bin/release/netcoreapp.1.0/publish</li>
    <li>
      <b>SCD</b>: ../bin/release/netcoreapp.1.0/ubuntu.16.04-x64</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2: (S)FTP Client</h3>
  <p>Depending on your hosting provider, you most likely will need an FTP client to move your files over. On Windows it is hard
    to argue against using
    <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" title="FileZilla" target="_blank">FileZilla</a> to get the job done.</p>
  <p>Configuration of your FTP client will be hosting specific. In the case of
    <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279"
      title="Digital Ocean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> they
    <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sftp-to-securely-transfer-files-with-a-remote-server"
      title="DigitalOcean SFTP Tutorial" target="_blank">recommend using SFTP and provide a tutorial for such</a>.</p>
  <h3>3: Moving Assets</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Create a folder on your new server to house your application and give your new user permissions to it.
      <b>{your-app}</b> equals your app name and
      <b>{user-name}</b> equals the none root user you created.
      <pre class="brush: bash">sudo mkdir /var/{your-app}
sudo chown {user-name}: /var/{your-app}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      User your (S)FTP client to move assets. Here is what it look like in FileZilla.
      <a href="/blogs/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host/filezilla.png" title="FileZilla Example"
        target="_blank">
        <img src="/blogs/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host/filezilla.png" style="max-width: 721px;"
          alt="FileZilla Example" />
      </a>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Start Your Site</h2>
  <p>Now that we have our server configured and our files moved, we can test everything out by starting the .NET Core application
    directly from our BASH command line. There is a lot of confusion about this on the internet, partly because the .NET
    Core documentation does not mention how to do so.</p>
  <p>Navigate to your application folder and run the following command.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">dotnet name.of.your.app.dll</pre>
  <p>Be sure to update the command above to reflect the name of your projects DLL.</p>
  <p>At this point you should see .NET Core logging on the command line stating "
    <b>Now listening on: http://localhost:5000</b>". Recall that we told Ngnix to proxy all request coming in on port 80 to
    <b>http://localhost:5000</b>. Meaning, we now should be able to hit our public IP address and see our app running in all
    of its glory.</p>
  <p class="note">When you make a request in the browser to your server, keep an eye on your BASH command line. As request are ran, you will
    see additional .NET Core logging that will help you understand the state of your app at any given time.</p>
  <h2>Make Sure Your Site Continues To Run</h2>
  <p>Now that we confirmed our site actually runs, we need to figure out a way to keep it running. The problem with what we
    just did is the fact that the second we shutdown our command line, our site will no longer be running. To solve this
    we will use an application named
    <a href="http://supervisord.org/" title="Supervisor" target="_blank">Supervisor</a>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating
    systems.
    <cite>
      <a href="http://supervisord.org/" title="Supervisor" target="_blank">Supervisor</a>
    </cite>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Install Supervisor by running the following command on your server.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo apt-get install Supervisor</pre>
  <p>Once installed, we need to config Supervisor so that it will insure our site restart in the advent it dies.</p>
  <p>Navigate to to the following directory.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">cd /etc/supervisor/conf.d/</pre>
  <p>Create a config file where
    <b>{name}</b> equals name of file.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo touch {name}.conf</pre>
  <p>Open the file for editing with nano.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo nano {name}.conf</pre>
  <p>Copy and paste the following after you have updated all places that say
    <b>your-app</b> with the actual name of your app.</p>
  <pre>[program:your-app]
command=/usr/bin/dotnet /apps/your-app/your-app.dll
directory=/apps/your-app/
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/apps/log/your-app.err.log
stdout_logfile=/apps/log/your-app.out.log
environment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
user=www-data
stopsignal=INT
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true</pre>
  <p>Commit and save your changes by hitting
    <b>ctrl+x</b>, then
    <b>y</b> and finally
    <b>enter</b>.</p>
  <p>Reset Supervisor so that it grabs control of your applications process.</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash">sudo service supervisor stop
sudo service supervisor start</pre>
  <h2>Where Do We Go From Here</h2>
  <h3>Me</h3>
  <p>Now that I am comfortably running Pioneer Code on a Linux environment, I think the next logical step is for me to
    <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker"
      title="Docker Containers" target="_blank">containerize</a> my application and start to utilize
    <a href="https://www.docker.com/" title="Docker" target="_blank">Docker</a> for deployments.</p>
  <h3>You</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ensure you have a good understanding of NGINX and get your site secure ASAP.
