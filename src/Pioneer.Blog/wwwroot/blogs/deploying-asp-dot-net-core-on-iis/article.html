<p>Unlike its predecessor ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core is not "hosted" inside of IIS or for that matter any incarnation of a third-party
  web server. Instead, ASP.NET Core runs as a standalone process backed by Kestrel.</p>
<blockquote>
  Kestrel is a cross-platform HTTP server based on libuv, a cross-platform asynchronous I/O library.

      target="_blank">Web server implementations in ASP.NET Core</a>
  </cite>
</blockquote>
<p>When an HTTP request is made to your ASP.NET Core application, it first hits Kestrel. Kestrel then manages that request and
  passes it your application code. Your application code processes that request and sends a response back up the pipeline.
</p>
<div class="callout success">
  <p class="text-center">
    <b>Network</b>
    <=< span style="font-size: 14px;">HTTP</span> =>
      <b>Kestrel</b>
      <=< span style="font-size: 14px;">HttpContext</span> =>
        <b>Application Code</b>
  </p>
</div>
<p>Kestrel's primary focus is performance and it is not intended to be a feature rich option when it comes to exposing your
  application to the public. Because of this, we need to introduce a new layer to the pipeline that will act as a reverse
  proxy server. We introduce this layer because with it, typically comes a server that can handle all the additional features
  needed to safely and efficiently expose our applications to the public. </p>
<div class="callout success">
  <p class="text-center">
    <b>Network</b>
    <=< span style="font-size: 14px;">HTTP</span> =>
      <b>Reverse Proxy Server</b>
      <=< span style="font-size: 14px;">HTTP</span> =>
        <b>Kestrel</b>
        <=< span style="font-size: 14px;">HttpContext</span> =>

<p>Because ASP.NET Core is cross-platform, we have a number of servers we can choose from such as IIS, Apache, and Nginx. The
  primary focus of this post will be to show how to setup IIS to proxy accordingly. If you are interested in Nginx, the following
  posts will be of value.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>In order to get IIS and the server it lives on in a state that it will face your ASP.NET Core application to the public,
  we need to install three things.</p>
<ol>
  <li>.NET Core Runtime</li>
  <li>.NET Core Library</li>
  <li>ASP.NET Core Module</li>
</ol>
<p>The ASP.NET team has bundled these three items up into package named
  <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=844461" target="_blank" title=".NET Core Windows Server Hosting">.NET Core Windows Server Hosting</a>. You can install the package using that executable but like anything else I do, I
  like to use Chocolatey whenever possible. To do so, run the following command.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">choco install dotnetcore-windowshosting -y</pre>
<p>In some cases, this package actually lags behind the official .NET Core SDK. Depending on the version of .NET Core your application
  is running on, you might have to manually update the SDK from
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2017">
    the official download site</a> or run the following Chocolatey command.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">choco install dotnetcore-sdk -y</pre>
<p>After your installs complete, we should be ready to deploy your site to IIS.</p>
<h2>Deploying to IIS</h2>
<h4>Confirmation</h4>
<p>Open up your instance of IIS, head to the
  <b>Modules</b> section and confirm the
  <b>AspNetCoreModule</b> is available. If you do not see it, you might have to restart IIS before it is properly loaded.</p>

  />
</a>
<h3>Deploying</h3>
<p>Regardless of how you deploy your application, be it manually, through continuous integration, or by Web Deploy, the following
  will need to happen.</p>
<h4>Creating A Site</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Right-Click the
    <b>Sites</b> node in IIS and select
    <b>Add Website</b>.</li>
  <li>Configure your site accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<a href="/blogs/deploying-asp-dot-net-core-on-iis/create-site.png" title="IIS Create Site" target="_blank">
  <img src="/blogs/deploying-asp-dot-net-core-on-iis/create-site.png" alt="IIS Create Site" style="max-width: 599px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"
  />
</a>
<h4>Configuring You Application Pool</h4>
<p>When you create a site, it automatically creates an Application Pool to run it under. Head to the Application Pool section
  of your IIS portal, find the newly created Application Pool and ensure it matches the following configuration.</p>
<a href="/blogs/deploying-asp-dot-net-core-on-iis/app-pool.png" title="IIS Create Site" target="_blank">
  <img src="/blogs/deploying-asp-dot-net-core-on-iis/app-pool.png" alt="IIS Create Site" style="max-width: 316px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"
  />
</a>
<p>That is it! Your .NET Core application will now be fronted by IIS affording you the opportunity to surround it with any features
  that are available inside of IIS. Pretty simple, right!</p>
