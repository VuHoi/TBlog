<p>As I progress through migrating this site from ASP.NET 4.6.x to ASP.NET Core, there are some packages that I used in the
  former that no longer suit my needs in the latter. One of these packages included a class library and HtmlHelper that could
  be used in conjunction to generate pagination markup and data. </p>
<p>In addition to this package not being supported in ASP.NET Core MVC, it also has a few constructs that did not meet my needs
  moving forward. That being said, I decided it best I produce
  <a href="https://github.com/PioneerCode/pioneer-pagination"
    target="_blank" title="Pioneer Pagination GitHub">my own solution</a> and share it with the community.</p>

  Pagination is used in some form in almost every web application to divide returned data and display it on multiple pages.
  Pagination also includes the logic of preparing and displaying the links to the various pages.

<p>Pagination itself is a three step story.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Acquisition of data.</li>
  <li>Generation of metadata to support the generation of markup.</li>
  <li>Generating markup based on metadata.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Acquiring Data</h3>
<p>Gathering a "page" of data is a distinct operation in itself. It should be treated independently of any desired destination
  and because of such,
  <a href="https://github.com/PioneerCode/pioneer-pagination" target="_blank" title="Pioneer Pagination GitHub">Pioneer Pagination</a> makes no effort nor has a desire to couple step 1 with steps 2 and 3. Instead, it leaves that option
  up to the user as opposed to assuming what the user wants.</p>
<p>One such example on how to acquire paged data, which I use for this blog, is to implement paging in
  <a href="http://www.asp.net/entity-framework"
    target="_blank" title="Entity Framework">Entity Framework</a>. More specifically two
  <a href="http://www.asp.net/entity-framework" target="_blank" title="Entity Framework">Entity Framework</a> extension methods, Skip and Take. </p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">public IEnumerable&lt;PostEntity&gt; GetAllPaged(int count, int page = 1)
{
    return _blogContext
            .Posts
            .Where(x => x.Published)
            .OrderByDescending(x => x.PostedOn)
            .Skip((page - 1) * count)
            .Take(count)
            .ToList();
}</pre>
<p>A request to this method will ask
  <a href="http://www.asp.net/entity-framework" target="_blank" title="Entity Framework">Entity Framework</a> to get a collection of pages by skipping (Skip) x and taking (Take) y. The count parameter signifies
  the total number of posts you want to Take and the page parameter represents a number of pages you want to Skip. </p>
<h2>Metadata</h2>
<p>In order to generate markup that will visually represent our paginated list, we must produce metadata that represents our
  desired state.
  <a href="https://github.com/PioneerCode/pioneer-pagination" target="_blank" title="Pioneer Pagination GitHub">Pioneer Pagination</a> handles this in the form of a service call.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">public ActionResult Index(int page = 1)
{
    // Typically obtained from a service/repository
    var totalNumberInCollection = 100;
	// Typically obtained from configuration
    var itemsPerPage = 5;
    ViewBag.PaginatedMeta = _paginatedMetaService.GetMetaData(totalNumberInCollection, page, itemsPerPage);
    return View("Blog", post);
}</pre>
<p>This data is bound to a controllers ViewBag as a means of supplying our
  <a href="https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro.html"
    target="_blank" title="ASP.NET Core MVC Tag Helper">Tag Helper</a> the information it needs to work its magic.</p>
<h2>Tag Helper</h2>
<blockquote>
  Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files.

  </cite>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Now that we have a "page" of data to display, we need to use that information in conjunction our metadata to produce a paginated
  list.
