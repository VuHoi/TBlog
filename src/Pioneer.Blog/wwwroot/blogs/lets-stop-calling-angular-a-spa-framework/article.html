<p>Are
  <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" title="Angular 2">Angular 2</a> and
  <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" title="Angular 1">AngularJs</a> (Angular 1) really
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank" title="Single Page Application">SPA</a> frameworks? Personally, I say no. That being said, I continue to hear it be lumped in with discussions solely focused
  on Single Page Application development.</p>
<p>I get it, AngularJs (Angular 1) road the same train that was started when the idea of a SPA got popular. At the time it had
  an intelligent approach that helped solve some problems associated with developing SPAs and packaged it together with additional
  functionality making it one of the most trusted and popular frameworks out there. </p>
<p>If we were to take a step back though and really ask ourselves what problems did SPAs introduce, we might start to see a
  clearer picture as to why lumping Angular in with only SPAs is not painting a clear picture of the framework.</p>
<p>Some of the more popular components of AngularJs are...</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank" title="Dependency Injection">Dependency Injection</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components" target="_blank" title="Web Components">Directives</a>
  </li>
  <li>MVW</li>
  <li>Data-Binding</li>
  <li>Routing</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of this group I would argue the only one that can be identified as being more prevalent with the rise of SPAs is Routing.
  Routing alone though does not mean the use of Angular is best suited for SPA development. In fact, I believe it to be the
  opposite. </p>
<h2>We Live In a World of Receptacles</h2>
<p>At my day-to-day, we deal with large enterprise applications that require user interactions that are beyond the scope of
  SPAs. Even with that being the case, we hedged our bets on Angular early and it has since served us well. Angular helped
  shape "best-practice" patterns into our code, added rich interactions to our client apps and allowed us to all speak the
  same language when it came to designing and architecting our front-end apps. </p>
<p>When examining how we have had success with Angular in our projects, we quickly started to see that limiting its definition
  to that of SPAs does not accurately describe our application of Angular.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at it as one framework made up of multiple components resulting in a complete end to end user experience,
  we shifted our mindset a bit. We started to look at our front-end applications as a collection of receptacles that are
  made up of a number of components, of which include this framework. </p>

<p>These subtle but important mindset shifts helped our team look beyond the scope of the SPA architecture and allowed us to
  implement practices that considered problems reaching "further down the road". Code reuse was raised across the board and
  maintainability was bolstered from project to project. </p>
