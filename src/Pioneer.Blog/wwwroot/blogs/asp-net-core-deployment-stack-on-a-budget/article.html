<p>In this post, I will continue with the "budget" theme we explored in "
  <a href="/post/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host"
    title="Developing A .NET Core Site In Windows and Deploying It To A Budget Linux Host" target="_blank">Developing A .NET Core Site In Windows and Deploying It To A Budget Linux Host</a>" and breakdown where and how I host
  my database, email services, dedicated production VM and dedicated dev shared hosting environment for Pioneer Code. Oh
  yeah, did I mention that I do this all for as low as
  <b>$7.95 a month</b>!</p>
<h2>Production VM at
  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>
</h2>
<p>Prior to migrating from ASP.NET 4.6.x to ASP.NET Core 1.x, I hosted Pioneer Code on a shared hosting plan at
  <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr"
    title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a>. When I switched over to ASP.NET Core I wanted a bit more control of my environment which lead me down the
  path of finding a Linux Hosted VM provider. Keeping the "budget" them in mind, I chose
  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279"
    title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>. Their base "droplet (VM)" comes in at
  <b>$5.00</b> a month and can be scaled as needed. Can't get much cheaper than that and if you're curious, their service so
  far has been stellar.</p>
<p>For more information on my entire deployment process to
  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean"

<h2>Everything Else At
  <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a>
</h2>
<p>What about your database? What about your email services? Well, that is where
  <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost"
    target="_blank">WinHost</a> steps in. Having dealt with them for over a year with no problems and comparing dollar for dollar against other
  Windows shared hosting companies, I found little reason not to continue using them to fill in the gaps. Oh, and guess what?
  I am doing so for
  <b>$3.95</b> a month.</p>
<h3>Database</h3>
<p>Naturally, though not necessary, Pioneer Code is backed by a SQL Server database. To be more specific, SQL Server 2016. This
  left me with few options.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Host my database at
    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/" title="Azure SQL Server">Azure</a> for
    <b>$4.99</b> on their base plan and find another third-party provider for my email services.
    <ul>
      <li>Though
        <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/" title="Azure SQL Server">Azure</a> was enticing, if we are to continue down the road of "budget friendly", there are better options. Especially
        when consider you will need to take on a third cost for your email services.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Find a competitor to
    <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> switch to them.
    <ul>
      <li>Though
        <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> is typically highly regarded, some would argue that another service provider might be better. From experience,
        I have had little to no problems with
        <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> over the past year or so.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Stick with what I know best,
    <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a>!
    <ul>
      <li>Their base plan is only
        <b>$3.95</b> a month! I have yet to find anyone else who can top that.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In short, I am hosting my production database at
  <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> and accessing it through my
  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean"
    target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> VM.</p>
<p class="note">
  <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> servers appear to be on the west coast. Obviously, there is a desire to get your SQL Server as close to your
  Web Server as possible. Luckily
  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> allows you to select from a number regions to host your "droplets (VM)). Meaning, in theory, I was able
  to get my database and web server "relatively" close to each other.</p>
<h3>Development Environment & Email Services</h3>
<p>The
  <b>$3.95</b> base plan
  <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> offers also covers my email services. As a bonus, I also get to use the shared hosting service include for
  whatever I want. Currently, I am using it as a development deployment for various projects, but there is nothing to stop
  me from using it for another small production deployment.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let's do a small recap.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> at
    <b>$5.00</b> a month.
    <ul>
      <li>Linux VM that is scalable as needed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> at
    <b>$3.95</b> a month.
    <ul>
      <li>Production Database</li>
      <li>Email Services</li>
      <li>Additional shared hosting deployment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>All that for
  <b>$8.95</b> a month! If that is not "budget friendly", I don't know what is.</p>
<p class="note">My goals when choosing my deployment stack where simple, do it for as cheap as I can while maintaining a decent level of
  quality. Of which I think accomplished. That being said, I am not delusional. If Pioneer Code starts gaining significant
  traffic, my deployment stack might have to be adjusted to suit those needs. Until then, I am perfectly happy with where
  I am at.</p>
